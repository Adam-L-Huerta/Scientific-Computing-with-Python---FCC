Project 1 - Arithmetic Formatter

Lessons from project 1: 
- Think through the entire build and plan each step before beginning to write code. I did this by drawing out the flow of the program and creating stub entries for functions/helper functions I would need. More time needed to be spent choosing the appropriate data structure (need to return to htdp.org design recipes!) 
- Make each step managable.  Writing and testing were performed on each function as each was finished to help avoid wasting time chasing bugs later. This also helps focus efforts and make steady progress. 
- The two lessons above need to be done in such a way that the work could be delegated to another. Work on cultivating this mindset when planning. Not "just a programmer" but a software engineer! 
- Don't forget about handling whitespaces! I remembered projects written in the past failing due to trailing whitespaces so a quick inspection of the output revealed it was trailing whitespaces that were causing my tests to fail yet again. In the future I will make note of how white spaces need to be handled during the planning stages.
- Be aware of the powerful tools available to you and how asking the right questions will help you find them.
